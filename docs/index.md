## What is Selfhosted?

A Docker Swarm-based homelab deployment platform that simplifies running multiple self-hosted services. With pre-configured compose files for 12+ popular services, automatic SSL certificates via Traefik, and network storage integration, you can have a complete homelab infrastructure running in minutes.

!!! tip "What is self-hosting?"
    Self-hosting is the practice of running and maintaining your own services instead of relying on third-party providers, giving you control over your data and infrastructure. For more information, see [r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/wiki/index).
