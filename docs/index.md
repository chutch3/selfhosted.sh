## What is Selfhosted?

A modern, unified self-hosted platform that makes deploying and managing services incredibly simple. Define your services once in YAML, and automatically generate deployment files for Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, or Kubernetes.

!!! tip "What is self-hosting?"
    Self-hosting is the practice of running and maintaining your own services instead of relying on third-party providers, giving you control over your data and infrastructure. For more information, see [r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/wiki/index).

## 🎯 Quick Example

Adding a new service is incredibly simple:

```yaml title="config/services.yaml"
myservice:
  name: "My Amazing Service"
  description: "Does incredible things"
  category: productivity
  domain: "myapp"
  port: 3000
  compose:
    image: "myapp:latest"
    ports: ["3000:3000"]
    environment:
      - "ADMIN_EMAIL=${ADMIN_EMAIL}"
  nginx:
    upstream: "myservice:3000"
    additional_config: |
      location / {
          proxy_pass http://myservice:3000;
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
      }
```

Then generate and deploy:

```bash
./selfhosted service generate  # Auto-generates all deployment files
./selfhosted deploy compose up # Deploy instantly
```

That's it! The system automatically creates docker-compose.yaml, nginx templates, domain variables, and SSL configuration.
