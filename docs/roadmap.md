# Mission

The mission of self-hosted is to:

- Use existing hardware
- Get up and running fast
- Enable data sovereignty and control
- Enable easy customization where needed
- Connect open source projects together
- Support multiple application domains (home media, homelab, privacy, smart home, etc.)
- Documentation and guides for getting started
