# Alternative 1: Pure Docker Swarm

echo "  Challenges:"
echo "  ❌ No SSH setup automation"
echo "  ❌ No pre-swarm machine configuration"

echo "  ❌ No structured machine inventory"
echo "  ✅ Great for runtime, poor for setup"

# Alternative 2: Ansible/Other IaC

echo "  3. Add examples of when to use each approach"
echo "  4. Update architecture documentation"

echo "🔧 Code improvements:"
echo "  1. Add validation for machines.yml format"
