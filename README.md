This project provides an automated, Docker-based self-hosted environment for running services with automated SSL certificate management, reverse proxying, and service orchestration. It's designed to be a simple yet production-ready framework for running your own services.

> **What is self-hosting?**
>
> Self-hosting is the practice of running and maintaining your own services instead of relying on third-party providers, giving you control over your data and infrastructure. For more information, see [r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/wiki/index).
