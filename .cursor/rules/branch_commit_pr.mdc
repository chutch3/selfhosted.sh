# BRANCHING, COMMIT, AND PR RULES

## 1. Branch Management
- **Before starting a new issue**, create and check out a new branch.
- Use clear branch naming conventions tied to the issue number.

## 2. Pull Request Guidelines
- Open one PR per issue.
- PR must include:
  - A summary of the changes.
  - A list of TDD cycles performed.
  - A link to the state log.

## 3. Commit Rules
- Commit frequently.
- Each commit message:
  - Must be a single line.
  - Must follow **Conventional Commits** format.
- Always choose the simplest possible solution.
