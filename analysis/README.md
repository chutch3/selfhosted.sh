# Analysis Documentation Structure

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-08

## Overview

This directory contains all analysis documentation for the selfhosted.sh project, organized by deployment type and scope. **Critical Understanding**: Deployment types are mutually exclusive - Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes (future) are separate deployment paths that cannot be used simultaneously.

## Directory Structure

### üìÇ `/docker-compose/` - Docker Compose Specific Analyses
Analysis focused exclusively on Docker Compose deployment type:
- `docker-compose-service-enablement-analysis.md` - Service enablement for Docker Compose

**Context**: Docker Compose is used for single-node or manual multi-node deployments where services are deployed using `docker compose up -d`.

### üìÇ `/docker-swarm/` - Docker Swarm Specific Analyses
Analysis focused exclusively on Docker Swarm orchestrated deployment:
- `node-capability-analysis.md` - Node-specific deployment capabilities
- `role-based-filtering-analysis.md` - Manager/Worker role-based service placement
- `hardware-constraints-analysis.md` - Hardware-aware service deployment
- `legacy-multi-deployment-analysis.md` - Legacy analysis with incorrect multi-deployment assumptions

**Context**: Docker Swarm is used for orchestrated multi-node deployments with automatic scheduling, service discovery, and high availability.

### üìÇ `/shared/` - Cross-Deployment Analyses
Analysis that applies to multiple deployment types or focuses on shared components:
- `application-vs-service-config-analysis.md` - Application vs service configuration distinction
- `config-boundaries-validation.md` - Configuration boundaries and separation of concerns
- `config-dependencies-mapping.md` - Configuration file dependencies and relationships
- `data-flow-diagrams.md` - Generation engine data flow visualization
- `generation-inputs-mapping.md` - Generation engine input sources
- `services-config-consistency-analysis.md` - services.yaml consistency validation
- `services-schema-validation-analysis.md` - services.yaml schema validation
- `transformation-rules-analysis.md` - Configuration transformation rules
- `unified-approach-design.md` - Unified configuration approach analysis

**Context**: These analyses examine shared infrastructure like `config/services.yaml`, generation engine, and configuration patterns that apply regardless of deployment type choice.

### üìÇ `/architecture/` - High-Level Architecture
System-wide architectural analysis and project summaries:
- `completed-work-summary.md` - Summary of all completed analysis work
- `new-architecture-issues-summary.md` - Summary of GitHub issues created from architecture diagram

**Context**: High-level architectural decisions, project summaries, and cross-cutting concerns.

## Deployment Type Context

### üê≥ Docker Compose Deployment
- **Use Case**: Development, single-node production, manual multi-node coordination
- **Artifacts**: `generated-docker-compose.yaml`, `generated-nginx/`, `.domains`
- **Management**: Manual service management with `docker compose` commands
- **Scope**: Current architecture diagram represents this deployment type

### üêù Docker Swarm Deployment
- **Use Case**: Orchestrated multi-node production with automatic failover
- **Artifacts**: `generated-swarm-stack.yaml`, `generated-nginx/`, `.domains`
- **Management**: Swarm-orchestrated with automatic scheduling and discovery
- **Scope**: Future enhancement for production multi-node deployments

### ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Deployment (Future)
- **Use Case**: Advanced enterprise orchestration
- **Artifacts**: `generated-k8s/`, `generated-nginx/`, `.domains`
- **Management**: Kubernetes orchestration
- **Scope**: Future roadmap item

## Analysis Principles

### üéØ Deployment Type Separation
Each deployment type analysis should:
- Focus exclusively on that deployment type's concerns
- Not make assumptions about other deployment types
- Clearly identify deployment-specific features and limitations
- Provide recommendations appropriate for that deployment context

### üîÑ Shared Component Analysis
Shared analyses should:
- Identify how components work across deployment types
- Specify deployment-specific behaviors where they differ
- Focus on common patterns and reusable infrastructure
- Avoid deployment-specific implementation details

### üìä Documentation Quality
All analyses should:
- Include clear executive summaries
- Provide concrete examples and code snippets
- Specify the scope and context of the analysis
- Include actionable recommendations
- Reference relevant GitHub issues

## Navigation Guide

### For Docker Compose Development:
1. Start with `/docker-compose/` analyses
2. Reference `/shared/` for configuration understanding
3. Check `/architecture/` for broader context

### For Docker Swarm Planning:
1. Review `/docker-swarm/` analyses
2. Reference `/shared/` for shared infrastructure
3. Compare with `/docker-compose/` for differences

### For Configuration Work:
1. Focus on `/shared/` analyses
2. Check deployment-specific implications in type-specific directories
3. Validate against `/architecture/` for system-wide impact

## Future Organization

As the project evolves:
- `/kubernetes/` directory will be added for K8s-specific analyses
- Additional deployment types can be added as separate directories
- Shared analyses should be moved to appropriate subdirectories
- Legacy analyses should be clearly marked and moved to archive

---

**Key Principle**: Deployment types are mutually exclusive. Choose one deployment type for your environment and focus on analyses relevant to that choice.
