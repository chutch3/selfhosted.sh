# Analysis Documentation Structure

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-08

## Overview

This directory contains all analysis documentation for the selfhosted.sh project. **Status**: Most analyses have been **superseded by the new simplified unified configuration approach** using `homelab.yaml`.

**Current Focus**: The project now uses a single, simple `homelab.yaml` configuration file that replaces the previous multi-file approach (`services.yaml` + `machines.yml` + `volumes.yaml` + `.env`).

**Key Change**: Deployment types remain mutually exclusive (Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes), but configuration is now unified with deployment-specific translation engines.

## Directory Structure

### üìÇ `/docker-compose/` - Docker Compose Specific Analyses
Analysis focused exclusively on Docker Compose deployment type:
- `docker-compose-service-enablement-analysis.md` - Service enablement for Docker Compose

**Context**: Docker Compose is used for single-node or manual multi-node deployments where services are deployed using `docker compose up -d`.

### üìÇ `/docker-swarm/` - Docker Swarm Specific Analyses
Analysis focused exclusively on Docker Swarm orchestrated deployment:
- `node-capability-analysis.md` - Node-specific deployment capabilities
- `role-based-filtering-analysis.md` - Manager/Worker role-based service placement
- `hardware-constraints-analysis.md` - Hardware-aware service deployment
- `legacy-multi-deployment-analysis.md` - Legacy analysis with incorrect multi-deployment assumptions

**Context**: Docker Swarm is used for orchestrated multi-node deployments with automatic scheduling, service discovery, and high availability.

### üìÇ `/shared/` - Cross-Deployment Analyses
**Status**: Most files superseded by unified configuration approach. Current focus:
- `simple-abstract-config-design.md` - **CURRENT**: Simplified unified configuration design
- `abstract-configuration-design.md` - **SUPERSEDED**: Previous complex design (too verbose)
- `data-flow-diagrams.md` - **UPDATED**: Data flow for new translation engines

**Legacy Files** (superseded by unified approach):
- `application-vs-service-config-analysis.md` - No longer needed (single config file)
- `config-boundaries-validation.md` - No longer needed (no boundaries)
- `config-dependencies-mapping.md` - No longer needed (no dependencies)
- `generation-inputs-mapping.md` - Replaced by translation engines
- `services-config-consistency-analysis.md` - Replaced by schema validation
- `services-schema-validation-analysis.md` - Replaced by homelab.yaml schema
- `transformation-rules-analysis.md` - Replaced by translation engines
- `unified-approach-design.md` - Replaced by simple design

**Context**: The new unified approach eliminates most configuration complexity through a single `homelab.yaml` file with smart defaults.

### üìÇ `/architecture/` - High-Level Architecture
System-wide architectural analysis and project summaries:
- `simple-implementation-plan.md` - **CURRENT**: 3-week implementation plan for unified config
- `implementation-plan-unified-config.md` - **SUPERSEDED**: Previous 6-week plan (too complex)
- `completed-work-summary.md` - **LEGACY**: Summary of old analysis work
- `new-architecture-issues-summary.md` - **LEGACY**: Superseded GitHub issues

**Context**: Focus on `simple-implementation-plan.md` for current development approach.

## New Unified Configuration Approach

### üéØ Current Implementation (Issues #33-40)

**Single Configuration**: `homelab.yaml` replaces all previous config files
```yaml
# homelab.yaml - Everything in one place
version: "2.0"
deployment: docker_compose  # or docker_swarm

machines:
  driver: {host: 192.168.1.100, user: ubuntu}

services:
  homepage:
    image: ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest
    port: 3000

  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports: [80, 443]
    deploy: all
```

### üê≥ Docker Compose Implementation (Issues #35-37)
- **Translation**: `homelab.yaml` ‚Üí per-machine `docker-compose.yaml` files
- **Distribution**: SSH-based deployment to each machine
- **Architecture**: Distributed nginx, machine-specific bundles

### üêù Docker Swarm Implementation (Issues #38-39)
- **Translation**: `homelab.yaml` ‚Üí single `docker-stack.yaml`
- **Orchestration**: Swarm placement constraints and service discovery
- **Architecture**: Centralized deployment, automatic scheduling

### ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes (Future)
- **Status**: Design placeholder only
- **Approach**: Same `homelab.yaml` ‚Üí K8s manifest translation

## Analysis Principles

### üéØ Deployment Type Separation
Each deployment type analysis should:
- Focus exclusively on that deployment type's concerns
- Not make assumptions about other deployment types
- Clearly identify deployment-specific features and limitations
- Provide recommendations appropriate for that deployment context

### üîÑ Shared Component Analysis
Shared analyses should:
- Identify how components work across deployment types
- Specify deployment-specific behaviors where they differ
- Focus on common patterns and reusable infrastructure
- Avoid deployment-specific implementation details

### üìä Documentation Quality
All analyses should:
- Include clear executive summaries
- Provide concrete examples and code snippets
- Specify the scope and context of the analysis
- Include actionable recommendations
- Reference relevant GitHub issues

## Navigation Guide

### For Current Development:
1. **Start with**: `architecture/simple-implementation-plan.md` - Current roadmap
2. **Configuration**: `shared/simple-abstract-config-design.md` - New unified approach
3. **GitHub Issues**: Issues #33-40 contain detailed implementation specs

### For Docker Compose Implementation:
1. **Issues**: #35 (Translation), #36 (Nginx), #37 (Deployment)
2. **Legacy context**: `docker-compose/` directory (mostly superseded)

### For Docker Swarm Implementation:
1. **Issues**: #38 (Translation), #39 (Cluster Management)
2. **Legacy context**: `docker-swarm/` directory (mostly superseded)

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Active Documents:
- `architecture/simple-implementation-plan.md` - **Current roadmap**
- `shared/simple-abstract-config-design.md` - **Current design**
- `shared/data-flow-diagrams.md` - **Updated for new approach**

### üìö Legacy Documents:
- Most other files superseded by unified configuration approach
- Kept for historical reference and context

### üöÄ Implementation Tracking:
- **GitHub Issues #33-40**: Detailed implementation specifications
- **Estimated Timeline**: 3 weeks for basic functionality
- **Focus**: Docker Compose first, then Docker Swarm

---

**Key Principle**: Single `homelab.yaml` configuration file with deployment-specific translation engines. Choose Docker Compose or Docker Swarm as your deployment type.
