# Node Capability Detection Analysis

**Date**: 2025-01-08
**Purpose**: Analysis 11.1 - Identify node-specific needs and capability detection
**Issue**: [#31](https://github.com/chutch3/selfhosted.sh/issues/31) - Node-Specific Generation

## Executive Summary

This analysis investigates whether the current homelab system needs node-specific artifact generation, examines node capability detection requirements, and determines if different machines should receive different service configurations based on their capabilities.

## 1. Current Node Architecture Assessment

### 🖥️ Current Machine Configuration

#### Machine Definition Structure (`machines.yml.example`):
```yaml
managers:
  - hostname: manager-1
    ip: 192.168.1.10
    user: ubuntu
    role: manager
    labels:
      - "node.type=manager"
      - "storage.type=local"

workers:
  - hostname: worker-1
    ip: 192.168.1.11
    user: ubuntu
    role: worker
    labels:
      - "node.type=worker"
      - "storage.type=nfs"
      - "gpu.available=nvidia"
```

#### Current Node Differentiation:
- **Role-Based**: Manager vs Worker nodes in Docker Swarm
- **Infrastructure Only**: Primarily for SSH and deployment logistics
- **No Service Filtering**: All nodes receive identical service configurations

### 🔍 Current Generation Behavior Analysis

#### Generated Artifact Consistency:
```bash
# Current behavior: All nodes receive identical files
generated-docker-compose.yaml    # ✅ Same for all nodes
generated-nginx/                 # ✅ Same for all nodes
.domains                        # ✅ Same for all nodes
generated-swarm-stack.yaml      # ✅ Same for all nodes
```

#### Service Deployment Patterns:
- **Docker Compose**: Services deploy to any available node
- **Docker Swarm**: Services use standard placement (no node-specific constraints)
- **Load Balancing**: Natural distribution across available nodes

## 4. Current System Node-Specific Capabilities

### ✅ Existing Node-Specific Features

#### Docker Swarm Native Capabilities:
```yaml
# Current Docker Swarm placement options (available but unused)
services:
  reverse_proxy:
    deploy:
      mode: global              # ✅ Run on all nodes
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == manager  # ✅ Manager-only placement
```

#### Machine Configuration Support:
```yaml
# machines.yml supports labels and metadata
workers:
  - hostname: worker-1
    labels:
      - "storage.type=ssd"      # ✅ Custom labels supported
      - "gpu.available=true"    # ✅ Capability tagging possible
```

#### SSH-Based Deployment:
```bash
# scripts/machines.sh can target specific nodes
machines_get_ssh_user "worker-1"     # ✅ Node-specific operations
machines_parse                       # ✅ Node enumeration and metadata
```

### ❌ Missing Node-Specific Features

    compose: {...}

  specialized_service:
    # Optional manual targeting for users who want it
    name: "Specialized Service"
    compose: {...}
    swarm:
      deploy:
        placement:
          constraints: ["node.hostname == gpu-node-1"]  # Manual specification
```

**Benefits**:
- **✅ Backward compatible**: Existing configurations continue to work
