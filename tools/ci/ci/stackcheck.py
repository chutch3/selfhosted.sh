"""The invariants every stack in the tree must hold — the `ci check-stacks` verdict.

Three rules today: the ``x-homelab`` declarations resolve and are complete,
every stack declares a healthcheck, and the ratchet exempting the stacks that
predate that rule names only stacks that still need exempting. They share a
command because they share a question — is this tree deployable — and a tree
read once answers all three.

Convergence is what makes the second rule matter: the deploy waits for each
stack to converge before starting the next, and Swarm calls a task ``running``
the moment its process starts unless a healthcheck says otherwise. See
docs/architecture/overview.md, "What converged means".

:func:`parse_ratchet` is pure — the composition root does the file read.
