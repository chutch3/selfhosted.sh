"""The stack dependency graph declared by ``x-homelab: {requires: [...]}``.

Deploy order was the output of ``find``. It is now a topological sort of the
declarations. :class:`StackTree` owns the filesystem; :class:`DependencyGraph`
holds the logic and takes the tree, so its tests never touch disk.

Nothing here deploys — it only decides what order a deploy would use. The
invariants over the tree live in :mod:`ci.stackcheck`.
