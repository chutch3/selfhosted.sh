"""`ci plan` end to end: the real CLI against a real Swarm.

Everything below the command line is exercised for real — argv parsing, the
composition root, the stack tree, dependency resolution, the cluster read, and
the rendered plan on stdout. The only fixture is the world: a throwaway
single-node swarm carrying stacks whose compose files are also the repo the CLI
is pointed at, so the manifest and the deployment cannot disagree.

It is also the only place ``PRESENT`` is observed, since every stack in the
homelab is converged.

Runs against the local daemon only: the context is pinned to ``default`` and
the suite skips if that daemon is missing. A swarm it starts is a swarm it
leaves.
